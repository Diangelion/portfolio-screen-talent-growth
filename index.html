              <q>
                It's easy to feel hopeful on a beautiful day like today, but
                there will be dark days ahead of us too. There will be days
                where you feel all alone, and that's when hope is needed most.
                No matter how buried it gets, or how lost you feel, you must
                promise me that you will hold on to hope. Keep it alive. We have
                to be greater than what we suffer. My wish for you is to become
                hope; people need that. And even if we fail, what better way is
                there to live? As we look around here today, at all of the
                people who helped make us who we are, I know it feels like we're
                saying goodbye, but we will carry a piece of each other into
                everything that we do next, to remind us of who we are, and of
                who we're meant to be.</q

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
              I love to do some sports like Football, Badminton, and Table
              Tennis.

              <p>
                This is my most favourite sport. I love to play football since I
                was kid, maybe when I was at Elementary School. I play with my
                classmate together before class.

                Same as Football, I play Badminton since I was kid. But, the
                difference is I play Badminton with my siblings and I play
                Badminton when I was in the holidays.

              <p>
                I play table tennis since I was at Senior High School. I play
                table tennis during the class break. Or maybe during sports
                lessons.

            Nusantara University. I am a stubborn person, but i also accept
            criticism and suggestions to develop myself to be better in the
            future. Besides of that, I am an easy-going person and friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently learning about Front-End website development, such as
            HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and React. I love watching React Hooks and
            try to understand it, along with any new technologies applied in
            React. Tailwind with DaisyUI is also interested me. Besides tech, I
            also learning about Japanese because of anime, 'HAHA'. Thank you if
            you spend your time just to read this information about me. I am
            still continuing to make a new journey and to be better each day.
